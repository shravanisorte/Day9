Data Model Review by Peer

Step 1: Peer Review  
The initial version of the star schema was shared for peer feedback.  
Reviewer: Varsha  

Feedback:  
• The overall structure looked strong, and the use of surrogate keys was appropriate.  
• I suggested clearly defining the grain for each fact table to avoid confusion down the line.  
• We also discussed the importance of keeping naming consistent across all tables — a small detail that makes a big difference.  
• One important note was ensuring that SCD Type 2 was applied consistently in dimensions like DimCustomer, especially since customer attributes can change over time.

Step 2: Model Refinement  
The team took the feedback seriously and made the following improvements:  
• She defined the grain explicitly for each fact table (for example, “one row per sales transaction line”).  
• All table and column names were cleaned up to follow a consistent naming convention.  
• SCD Type 2 logic was fully implemented in DimCustomer using surrogate keys, date ranges, and current flags.

Step 3: Validation & Confidence Building  
The updated model was shared back for final review.  
• The changes were solid — the model is now much more clear, consistent, and scalable.  
• It now follows best practices in dimensional design and historical data tracking.  

Result:  
• Demonstrated a well-structured model she feels confident moving forward with.  
• The design is ready for the next phase — development and testing.  
• This round of feedback helped clarify some of the grey areas and gave everyone more confidence in their modeling approach.
